# analysis-of-sorting-algorithms

Implementing different sorting algorithms to analyze them theoretical and empirical. In the analysis phase, different types of inputs(sorted,unsorted,semi-sorted, etc.)
used for observing their time and space complexity. 
Aim of the project is obtaining a strong idea which sorting algorithm is optimum in different conditions.
